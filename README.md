## RNN for Human Activity Recognition - 2D Pose Input

This experiment is the classification of human activities using a 2D pose time series dataset and an LSTM RNN.
The idea is to prove the concept that using a series of 2D poses, rather than 3D poses or a raw 2D images, can produce an accurate estimation of the behaviour of a person or animal.
This is a step towards creating a method of classifying an animal's current behaviour state and predicting it's likely next state, allowing for better interaction with an autonomous mobile robot.

## Objectives

The aims of this experiment are:

-  To determine if 2D pose has comparable accuracy to 3D pose for use in activity recognition. This would allow the use of RGB only cameras for human and animal pose estimation, as opposed to RGBD or a large motion capture dataset.


- To determine if  2D pose has comparable accuracy to using raw RGB images for use in activity recognition. This is based on the idea that limiting the input feature vector can help to deal with a limited dataset, as is likely to occur in animal activity recognition, by allowing for a smaller model to be used (citation required).


- To verify the concept for use in future works involving behaviour prediction from motion in 2D images.

The network used in this experiment is based on that of Guillaume Chevalier, 'LSTMs for Human Activity Recognition, 2016'  https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/LSTM-Human-Activity-Recognition, available under the MIT License.
Notable changes that have been made (other than accounting for dataset sizes) are:
 - Adapting for use with a large dataset ordered by class, using random sampling without replacement for mini-batch.  
 This allows for use of smaller batch sizes when using a dataset ordered by class. "It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a significant degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize"

## Dataset overview

The dataset consists of pose estimations, made using the software OpenPose (https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose's) on a subset of the Berkeley Multimodal Human Action Database (MHAD) dataset http://tele-immersion.citris-uc.org/berkeley_mhad.

This dataset is comprised of 12 subjects doing the following 6 actions for 5 repetitions, filmed from 4 angles, repeated 5 times each.  

- JUMPING,
- JUMPING_JACKS,
- BOXING,
- WAVING_2HANDS,
- WAVING_1HAND,
- CLAPPING_HANDS.

In total, there are 1438 videos (2 were missing) made up of 211200 individual frames.

The below image is an example of the 4 camera views during the 'boxing' action for subject 1

![alt text](images/boxing_all_views.gif.png "Title")

The input for the LSTM is the 2D position of 18 joints across a timeseries of frames numbering n_steps (window-width), with an associated class label for the frame series.  
A single frame's input (where j refers to a joint) is stored as:

[  j0_x,  j0_y, j1_x, j1_y , j2_x, j2_y, j3_x, j3_y, j4_x, j4_y, j5_x, j5_y, j6_x, j6_y, j7_x, j7_y, j8_x, j8_y, j9_x, j9_y, j10_x, j10_y, j11_x, j11_y, j12_x, j12_y, j13_x, j13_y, j14_x, j14_y, j15_x, j15_y, j16_x, j16_y, j17_x, j17_y ]

For the following experiment, very little preprocessing has been done to the dataset.  
The following steps were taken:
1. openpose run on individual frames, for each subject, action and view, outputting JSON of 18 joint x and y position keypoints and accuracies per frame
2. JSONs converted into txt format, keeping only x and y positions of each frame, action being performed during frame, and order of frames. This is used to create a database of associated activity class number and corresponding series of joint 2D positions
3. No further prepossessing was performed.  

In some cases, multiple people were detected in each frame, in which only the first detection was used.

The data has not been normalised with regards to subject position in the frame, motion across frame (if any), size of the subject, speed of action etc. It is essentially the raw 2D position of each joint viewed from a stationary camera.  
In many cases, individual joints were not located and a position of [0.0,0.0] was given for that joint

A summary of the dataset used for input is:

 - 211200 individual images 
 - n_steps = 32 frames (~=1.5s at 22Hz)
 - Images with noisy pose detection (detection of >=2 people) = 5132  
 - Training_split = 0.8
 - Overlap = 0.8125 (26 / 32) ie 26 frame overlap
   - Length X_train = 22625 * 32 frames
   - Length X_test = 5751 * 32 frames
   
Note that their is no overlap between test and train sets, which were seperated by activity repetition entirely, before creating the 26 of 32 frame overlap.

## Conclusion

Final accuracy of >90% is pretty good, considering that training takes about 7 minutes.

Noticeable confusion between activities of Clapping Hands and Boxing, and between Jumping Jacks and Waving Two Hands which is understandable.

In terms of the applicability of this to a wider dataset, I would imagine that it would be able to work for any activities in which the training included a views from all angles to be tested on. It would be interesting to see it's applicability to camera angles in between the 4 used in this dataset, without training on them specifically.

 Overall, this experiment validates the idea that 2D pose can be used for at least human activity recognition, and provides verification to continue onto use of 2D pose for behaviour estimation in both people and animals
 

 ### With regards to Using LSTM-RNNs
 - Batch sampling
     - It is neccessary to ensure you are not just sampling classes one at a time! (ie y_train is ordered by class and batch chosen in order)The use of random sampling of batches without replacement from the training data resolves this.    
 
 - Architecture
     - Testing has been run using a variety of hidden units per LSTM cell, with results showing that testing accuracy achieves a higher score when using a number of hidden cells approximately equal to that of the input, ie 34. The following figure displays the final accuracy achieved on the testing dataset for a variety of hidden units, all using a batch size of 4096 and 300 epochs (a total of 1657 iterations, with testing performed every 8th iteration).
   
 
 

## Future Works

Inclusion of :

 - A pipeline for qualitative results
 - A validation dataset
 - Momentum     
 - Normalise input data (each point with respect to distribution of itself only)
 - Dropout
 - Comparison of effect of changing batch size
 

Further research will be made into the use on more subtle activity classes, such as walking versus running, agitated movement versus calm movement, and perhaps normal versus abnormal behaviour, based on a baseline of normal motion.
