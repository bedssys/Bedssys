Installing new version of iidonet openpose (tf-pose-estimation).
1. Clone then install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Prevent downloading unused big data: Rename the models/pretrained & models/numpy.
3. Problems with pycoco:
    a. Install the asked modules.
        - latest version    : pip install <module> --upgrade
        - specific version  : pip install <module>==<version> --upgrade
        - wont uninstall    : pip install <module> --upgrade --ignore-installed
    b. rc.exe or something about Visual Studio
        - It's because the official pycoco doesn't support windows.
        - Use this instead: [https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/issues/169]
            pip3 install "git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#egg=pycocotools&subdirectory=PythonAPI"
        - Problem with rc.exe: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43858836/]
            Do as specified by the first answer (maybe)
            Use "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017" to run the command above.
2. Copy the tf_pose content to Bedssys/tf_pose
